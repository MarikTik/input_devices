# input_devices

`input_devices` is a Python library designed to provide a high-level API for interacting with various electronic input devices. This includes game controllers (such as Xbox and PlayStation controllers), joysticks, remote controllers, as well as computer peripherals like keyboards and mice. The goal of `input_devices` is to simplify the process of integrating these devices into Python projects by offering a straightforward and unified interface.

## Features

- **Game Controllers**: Support for Xbox Gen4 controllers.

## Future

- **Joysticks**: Compatibility with various models of joysticks.
- **Remote Controllers**: Integration with different types of remote control devices.
- **Computer Peripherals**: Support for keyboards and mice, facilitating complex input handling.
- **Extensible**: Designed to be easily extendable for more types of devices.

## Installation

Install `input_devices` using pip:

```bash
pip install input_devices
```

Quick Start

Here is a simple example of how to use input_devices to listen for inputs from an Xbox controller:

```python
from input_devices import XboxControllerGen4
from inputs import get_gamepad

#event subscription example
controller = XboxControllerGen4(get_gamepad())
controller.A.on_press(lambda: print("A pressed")) \
          .on_release(lambda: print("A released"), lambda: print("A released x2")) 

# interaction with different types of buttons
controller.directional_pad.up.on_press(lambda: print("D-pad up press"))
controller.directional_pad.left.on_release(lambda: print("D-pad down release"))

while True:
     # updating events and trigger states
     controller.update() 
     # getting mapped x axis value from left stick on the xbox controller
     print(controller.left_stick.get_mapped_x(), new_minimum=-1, new_maximum=1) 
     # getting raw y values from left trigger on the xbox controller
     print(controller.left_trigger.get_y()) # get pressure-sensitive input
```
